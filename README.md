# Bedrock JSON encoder
Encoder for Minecraft JSON Addons (and other file extensions)
Made by tanklesscamp658

It is very simple to use this program. 2 ways to use the program:
1. You can use directly in the website [here](https://tanklesscamp658.github.io/Bedrock-Json-encoder/)
2. You can download this repository as .zip, unzip it and open index.html file

This program is made for Minecraft addon makers that want to secure their code and do not allow anyone to steal it (although it is still able to decode the files, but at least it is much more secure than the original code)

Thanks for using the program!
